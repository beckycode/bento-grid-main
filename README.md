## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It was challenging to calculate how many rows and columns should I create to get this design alive.
CSS Grid definitely offers many advantages, and once you learn it, you start thinking what other places you can apply it. What I liked the most is the fact that you have different ways to work with Grid, For example:

- Template areas,
- Naming grid lines
- Working with template columns/rows and span.

In this project I used the last solution just to practice. I think with template areas would be definitely better but it helped me to understand the different approaches to get the same result. Good experiment.

I started with desktop-first-workflow and then I switched to mobile-first-workflow and and media queries for desktop. Good exercise

### Continued development

I would definitely like to apply more CSS Grids in my projects. I've been only using flexbox, which is easier too, but if I want to make a grid like this challenge or a galler, definitely CSS Grid is the best tool for that.
